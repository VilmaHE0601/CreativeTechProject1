For my week 2 assignment, I choose three API:

NASA image: https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod

NewYorkTimes articles: https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json

Weatherstack: http://api.weatherstack.com/current


In this website, the user will click on the 'Fetch Data' button by setting the past date. 
The site will automatically pull NASA images, NewYorkTimes articles from three APIs for that date. 
Originally, in my vision, Weatherstack was also supposed to be fetched the Pasadena weather for the current date set, 
but I realized that access rights to fetch historical weather requires a paid subscription, so I changed it to the current Pasaedna weather.




Here are some screenshots in my website:
